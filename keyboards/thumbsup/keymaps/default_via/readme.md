# The default keymap for thumbs_up - a copy specific for the Remap/VIA supporting firmware.
VIA requires a separate endpoint, I removed the steno support for it to free up the COM port one.
All the custom layer switches are removed not to interfere with the VIA layouts.
In essence it is a shell of a keyboard.
