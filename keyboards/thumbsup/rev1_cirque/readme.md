This is a default layout for ThumbsUp! v2 with Atmega32U4 soldered on the PCB and with DFU bootloader.
The column pins are repeating Planck rev4, but the rows are different - the top row pin was moved to free it up for SDA/SCL signals needed for Cirque trackpad.

Note in this initial revision the thumb keys are swapped in error.
I temporarily swapped them in info.json file.
The next revision will put in the right spots.
