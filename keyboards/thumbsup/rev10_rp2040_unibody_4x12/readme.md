This is a default layout for ThumbsUp! 10 with RP2040 soldered on the PCB.

Use the v10 default layout (to use the newly added 3rd thumb cluster key):

	qmk compile -c -kb thumbsup/rev10_rp2040_unibody_4x12 -km default_4x12_v10_via

IS THIS STILL TRUE?
Note in this initial revision the thumb keys are swapped in error.
I temporarily swapped them in info.json file.
The next revision will put in the right spots.
